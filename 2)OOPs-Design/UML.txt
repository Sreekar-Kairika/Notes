Sequence Diagram ::
Type of UMLDiagram
How objects and classes interact with each other during 
runtime.

Show sequence of events


Person --  Actor , Out of scope of sequnece diagrams
Objects are in -- Square

Vertical Lines -- shows existance
Now we start interaction

When we get back  messages we denote by dashed Line.
Dashed lines move from LEFT to RIGHT.


Activation Boxes -- How long Objects are active
solidblocks show activation boxes


HORIZONTAL::
IF INSTRUCTION -- USE SOLID Line
IF its Reply,Return,Respone -- Use Dashed Line

Alternative Frame is used to use IF/ELSE Cases
