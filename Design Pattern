A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design.
 
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.


TYPES oF DESIGN PATTERNS

1)Creational -
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. 
a)Class-creational patterns 
b)Object-creational patterns
While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done. 
EXAMPLES:: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool, and Prototype. 



2)Structural -
These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. 
Structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data, and Proxy. 

3)Behavioral - 
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns. 
Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor
