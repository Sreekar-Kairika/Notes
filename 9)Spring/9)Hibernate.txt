 
 Hibernate is a frameworl for persisting/saving Java Objects in a database
 
 Hibernate handles all low-level SQL
 It minimize the amount of JDBC code you have to devlop
 It provides Object-to-Relational Mapping
 
 Mapping from Java Class to DBMS Class 
 
 
 JDBC & Hibernate
 Hibernate uses JDBC for all database communicaions
 JDBC is a Abstract layer.
 JDBC Driver is used
 
 1)ide
 2)Database Server
 3)Hibernate JAR  & JDBC Driver
 
 
 HIBERNATE DEMO PROCESS
 1)Add Hibernate Config File -- add hibgernate.cfg.xml
 
 2)Annotate Java Class
 
 Entitry Class -Java class that is ampped to a database table
 ORM - Object to Relational Mapping 
 
 TWO OPTIONS FOR MAPPING
 a)XML config
 b)Java Annotations 
      --- Map Class to Databse Table
	  --- Map fields to Databse Column
 
 3)Develop Java Code to process Database Operations 
 
 
 ------------------
 
 Session Factory -- Reads the hibernate confog file , creates Session Objects , 
								Only create once in your app 

Session  ---  Wraps a JDBC Connection	
						Main object used to save/relative object
						Short lived object 
						Retrieved from Session Factory
