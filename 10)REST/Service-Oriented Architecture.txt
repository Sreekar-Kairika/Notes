
Service Oriented Architecture  -- 
modularity & service independent & extensibility & code reuse

Web serives are used over Internet 

======

SERVICES OF PRINCIPLES 


1)Modular -- loosely coupled , code resuablility 

2) Composable -- able to combine with other Applications
                  easily 
				  
3)Platform & Language Independent 
				  
4)Self-Describing -- 

5)Self-Advertising

Web System Evolutions 

	
ARPANET --- used in usa in 1969 to share information 
over a network 


HTML -- Hyper Text Markup Langauge

Static web pages -- publications & bolgs
They are stored in the server

1993 -- Dynamic Web Page
It is generated at time of Access
It is easy to change things in Dynamic Web Pages


 ------------------
 
 Web System Architecture 
 
 
 Web Browser ---- Web Server --- Application Server ---- Database
 
 No Application Server -- for static web pages 
 
 Application Server is used for Dyanmic Web page Loading 
 
 
------------------------

 HTML& XML -- Markup Languages 
 They relay on Tags 
 No programming syntax
 
 HTML -- focuses on strcuture not on styling 
 
 
 XML -- eXtensible Markup Langauge 
 Used to store & Transport data 
 Send data in a Web Based System 
 
 JSON -- Light Weigth
 Store & Transport Data 
 Popular
 Name,Value pairs 
 
 ---------------
 
 HTTP -- Hyper Text Tranfer Protocol
 
 HTTP is a protocol that dictates how information is transferred across
 the internet 
 
 
 URI -- Universal Resource Identifiers
 Address uswd to Idenetity Resource 
 
 URL -- Universal Resource Location
 URL subset of URI 
 
 DNS -- Domain Name Sysstem
 
 
 HTTP is built on TCP
 TCP -- Transmission Control Protocol
 TCP is Reliable. Ordered, Connection Oriented 
 
 
----------------
 
 Java Script -- It is embedded in script tag
 It is Intrepreted Language 
 
------------

RPC -- Remote Procedure Call 

System communicate with each other over a network

In RPC we have a Client & Server 
They communicat eusing Interface Defination Language 


RPC uses Procedures

-------------

Object Brokers

New Systems are build to take advantage of OOPs
