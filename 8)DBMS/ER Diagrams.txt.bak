 ERD has 3 main items
1)Entity Type[name: Student] -- collection of physical items 
2)Attributes[name,age] -- Keys
3)Relationships 
 
Cardinality ::

Underline is indicated as Primary Key

Course has Offering

Cardinality::

course1    off1
course2    off2
                  off3 

0<- -- zero cardinality
|-|  maximum cardinality 				  


Cardinality is the number of unique items in a column
If a class has 60 members , they have 60 different roll numbers 


Degree :: It is the number of entitys involved in the relationship.
Cardinality :: Relationship b/w two or more tables
a)1-1
b)1-M
c)M-1
d)M-M

Degree of a relation is the number of attribute of its relation schema and 
Cardinality of a relation is the number of tuples

Degree is the number of attributes or columns present in a table.
Cardinality is the number of tuples or rows present in a table.

 minimum is indicated Inside the line & maximum is indicated outside the Line
 
 ERD uses Relation ship in Diagram
