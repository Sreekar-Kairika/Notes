React creates a Copy of DOM 
 
React matches Actual DOM to Virtual DOM
 
If Virtual DOM gets updated , then Actual DOM is alos changed
 
Querys Actual DOM is expensive but updating is  easy
so we change Virtual DOm and its updated on Actual DOM
 
Actual DOM is expensive and time taking
 
 
 Virtual DOM is copy of DOm but light weight copy
 
But Virtual DOM cant decide what on Screen to Appear
 
Manipulating Virtual DOM is faster 
 
 If a Update/Change a single DOM all DOMS get updated its a problem
 
But Virtual DOM updates faster
 
Then Actual DOM compares itself  with Virtual DOM  and 
then update the Specific Object to real DOM.


React at any state contains two Virtual DOMS
  1)Updated V DOM
  2) Previous V DOM
