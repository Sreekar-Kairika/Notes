1)Seperate Concepts Vertically
Concepts similar to eachother should be maintained
vertically.

2)Related code should be vertically dense

3)Declare variables close to usage

4)Dependent functions should be grouped closed

5)Similar functions should be closed.

6)Place functions in downward direction 

7)Keep Lines short

8)Dont use Horizontal alignment
var a     = 10
var apple = 20
use 
a = 10
var apple =100
