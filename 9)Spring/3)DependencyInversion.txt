 Dependecy Inversion 
 
 
 Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that removes the dependency 
 from the programming code so that it can be easy to manage and test the application. 
 
 Dependency Injection makes our programming code loosely coupled
 
  Dependency Inversion is what decouples your code so Spring can use 
  Dependency Injection at run time.
  
  CarFactory Injects Engine Tyres Seats  to Car 
  
  Spring has Objects Factory , coach has other dependencys or helpers
  factory does the work for us.

  2)Dependecny Injection 
  
 Different Types Of Injections
 1)Constructor Injection 
 2)Setter Injection
 
 Devlopment Process
 1)Define Dependecny Interface
 2)Create a construcor in class for Injections
 3)Configure Dependency Injection 
 
 
 dependency is helper 
 
 2)SETTER INJECTION 
 Inject dependency by calling setters methods
 
 
 DEvlopment Process
 1)Create Setter
 2)Spring Configfile
