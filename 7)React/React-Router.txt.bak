Bowser Router everyint is wrapped in it
Route wrapped in Router 

element takes JSX elemets to navigate 

Outlet - where to display the children , open pipe there 

NavLink gives us isActive Property 

Acceess paramters 


To carry information we have two methods Navigate & Links also

 
 npm install react-router-dom
 // v6  is installed
 
 
 import {BrowserRouter as Router , Routes, Route} from 'react-router-dom'


 <Router>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home/>} />
    </Routes>
  </Router>
  
  
  
        <Route path="/myapps" element={< Navigate to = "/learn" />} />


      <Route path="/myapps" element={< Navigate replace to = "/learn" />} />


<a> tags reload entire page 
so we use Linlk


Outlet -- tells where inside the component it should appear


useParams -- to take & display data from router 

courseid params : 1 2 3 4


Navlinks is same as Links
NavLinks has some extra functionalitys 



To carry information futher into componenst we use Redux/State Management


We use here useNavigate && useLoaction 
 
navigate() is used to  send the infomation

location is used to collect information
