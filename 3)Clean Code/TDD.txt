TDD -- Test Driven Devlopment

We should first test and then write production code.


1- You are not allowed to write any production code
 unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
 
2- You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test
 than is sufficient to fail, and compilation failures
 are failures.
 
3- You are not allowed to write any more production code
 than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
 
 
 
FIRST
F - Fast -- Test cases should be quick to execute
I - Independent -- No dependency between them 
R - Repetable -- Must be able to run in any environment
S - Self Validating -- Test case can have two possible 
	values . Either FAILED or PASS
T - Timely -- Tests have to be created just before the code.
     Writing code first then test cases is more complex.
